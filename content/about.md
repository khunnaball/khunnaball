## About

Hi, I'm Kieran Hunnaball ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a backend developer from the UK and welcome to my site!

I work mainly with PHP and JS but I am very interested in many other languages like Python, Go, Rust etc.

I also am very interested in Cyber Security and Network Security as well as playing guitar and music theory!

Please feel free to check out my blog where I talk about all things music, development and anything I'm interested in really!
